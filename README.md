Yii 2 Advanced 6 Ends v0.0.1
=====================

Additions for giving Yii2 `API`, `assets`, `members`, & `midend` application ends.

Installation
------------

First create a new Yii2 Advanced project by running...

```
	composer create-project --prefer-dist yiisoft/yii2-app-advanced yii-application
```

*Before* running `init`, either...

Run *one* of the following commands:

```
	composer require p2made/yii2-a6e "^0.0"
```

or

```
	php composer.phar require p2made/yii2-a6e "^0.0"
```

*or* add:

```
	"p2made/yii2-a6e": "^0.0"
```

to the requires section of your `composer.json` & run `composer update`.

Next run...

```
	cp -r ./vendor/p2made/api
	cp -r ./vendor/p2made/assets
	cp -r ./vendor/p2made/members
	cp -r ./vendor/p2made/midend
	cp -r ./vendor/p2made/environments
```

The  `environments` will replace the original.

Now run `./init` as usual.
